'''10.	Write a number guessing game in Python with the following rules:
    The computer generates a random number between 1 and 50.
    The user must guess the number.
    After each guess, the program tells the user whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
    The user gets a maximum of 7 attempts.
    If the user does not guess correctly within the attempts, display “Better luck next time!” and end the game.
